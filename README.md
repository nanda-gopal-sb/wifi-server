## Introduction

This project aims to provide a simple and effective way to integrate Wifi functionality with NodeMCU. It includes sample code and detailed instructions to help you get started quickly.

## Requirements

- NodeMCU board
- Wifi module (e.g., HC-05, HC-06)
- Arduino IDE
- USB cable
- Jumper wires

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nodeMCU-Wifi.git
    ```
2. **Open the project in Arduino IDE:**
    - Open Arduino IDE.
    - Navigate to `File > Open` and select the `.ino` file from the cloned repository.

3. **Install necessary libraries:**
    - Ensure you have the required libraries installed in Arduino IDE.

## Usage

1. **Connect the Wifi module to NodeMCU:**
    - Connect the VCC and GND pins of the Wifi module to the 3.3V and GND pins of NodeMCU.
    - Connect the TX and RX pins of the Wifi module to the RX and TX pins of NodeMCU.

2. **Upload the code:**
    - Connect NodeMCU to your computer using a USB cable.
    - Select the correct board and port in Arduino IDE.
    - Click on the upload button to upload the code to NodeMCU.

3. **Pair the Wifi module:**
    - Use a Wifi-enabled device to search for and pair with the Wifi module.

4. **Run the project:**
    - Open a serial monitor in Arduino IDE to see the communication between NodeMCU and the paired device.
